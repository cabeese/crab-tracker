/******************************************************************************
Decodes unique identifiers from transmissions

The details of UID encoding and decoding can be found in the iCRAB Protocol
documentation (TransmissionProtocol.pdf).

Note that we expect some amount of noise or variance in our measured signals,
so we can't rely on the measured durations or delays matching perfectly with
our mathematical expectations. To compensate for this, we simply round each
decoded ID (as a float) to the nearest integer. This way, if a given duration
is 0.074ms longer than it "should be" based on our documentation, the small
error is thrown away.
