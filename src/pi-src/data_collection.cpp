/******************************************************************************
Data collection and initial processing

Polls the SPI slave for new data. The data comes in as raw "blocks" containing
a timestamp and a set of pin values. As these raw blocks are collected, they
are turned into "ping" structs that can be consumed by the higher-level
functions that will determine location and UID.
